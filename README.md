# QM_Algorithm

Quineâ€“McCluskey algorithm in Matlab.

It was done half a year ago, and no optimization has been done ever since.

## Features
* Hahn's first GitHub repo
* naive Matlab coding (one single function with 184 lines)
* naive LaTeX typesetting (actually my first try in writing a report with LaTeX)
